# Tea Collection Management

A Flutter web application designed for efficient tea collection and logistics management.

## Framework

Built with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).

## Description

**Tea Collection Management** is a web application developed using Flutter, focused on leveraging Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to improve the efficiency and reliability of tea collection processes.

- **Route Planning for Tea Collection Trucks**: The application has an integrated system for generating the most efficient routes for tea collection trucks. This ensures that each truck collects tea in the shortest time, reducing fuel costs and maximizing daily collection.

- **Optimal Path Analysis**: Based on the location of various tea collection centers, the system performs an optimal path analysis. This means that routes are not only efficient but also optimized for traffic, weather conditions, and other potential disruptions.

- **Navigation using Mapbox SDK**: The application incorporates the [Mapbox SDK](https://www.mapbox.com/) to provide real-time navigation. This ensures that truck drivers have clear, accurate directions to each collection center, preventing delays and ensuring timely collection.
